# Running Locally

## Server

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Try with a client

For this you'll have to use a websocket client. I recommend something like [`wscat`](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) or [`websocet`](https://github.com/vi/websocat)

```
â†ª wscat -c "ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket"
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
